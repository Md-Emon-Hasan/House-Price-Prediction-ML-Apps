## 📖 Introduction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting house prices using supervised learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and deployment aspects of the project.

---

## 🎯 Why This Project

The primary motivation behind creating this project is to leverage machine learning to predict house prices accurately. This can aid real estate agents, buyers, and sellers in making informed decisions based on data-driven predictions.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about various features of houses, such as size, location, number of rooms, etc. It is crucial for predicting house prices accurately.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and transformed dataset for machine learning model compatibility.
- **Model Development:** Trained multiple machine learning models to predict house prices.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated models using appropriate metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- **Deployment:** Implemented a simple web application for demonstrating house price predictions (if applicable).

---

## 🧠 Models Implemented

Several machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor (if applicable)

Each model's performance was compared based on metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and others.

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
- **R-squared (R2):** Indicates how well the model fits the data, with higher values indicating better fit.
